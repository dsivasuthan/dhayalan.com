      <description>When you spend half your wake time on the interwebs every single day, you are bound to come across some materials that you find amusing, clever or motivating. That does not mean, I need constant motivation through somebody else&amp;rsquo;s work but some work or compilation do open a different kind world you have never explored or thought of. The following are some of meterials I had clipped some years back on Evernote (sorry, Evernote, you dug your own grave).</description>

      <title>Setting up Linux for Web Development</title>

      <description>I have been using Windows for the last 15 years. I have always used Linux on the side for fun and tinkering but never tried it full time until a couple of years ago. I have been trying various distros for a while now, switching between Ubuntu Unity, Linux Cinamon, Manjaro, until I tried Kubuntu with KDE plasma. The sheer amount of cuztomizations right out of the box and support for HiDPI screen for Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro meant I could stick to this for a while.</description>

      <description>These projects are done in my free time and most of them are as old as 15 years. Work projects are not listed here, but they showcase my skills better than any of these projects do. Contact me if you want to know about my work projects. Thank you.
Simple Sketch - Android Application  I got tired of feature-rich and slow note-taking apps that require whole bunch of permissions to run.</description>
