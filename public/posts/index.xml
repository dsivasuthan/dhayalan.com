      <description>As I much as I do like to boast about the sheer amount podcasts listen(ed) to, it is not the intention of this posts. Rather, I find this a good place to share such details about me and document myself. I don&amp;rsquo;t facebook telling 3rd party service that I am into money just because I listen to Freakonomic and Planet Money. This page is something I control and no third party has access to it (except Google analytics, until I configure matamo).</description>

      <description>When you spend half your wake time on the interwebs every single day, you are bound to come across some materials that you find amusing, clever or motivating. That does not mean I need constant motivation through somebody else&amp;rsquo;s work but some works do open a different kind world you have never explored or thought of. The following are some of the materials I had clipped some years back on Evernote (sorry, Evernote, you dug your own grave).</description>

      <description>I have been using Windows for the last 15 years. I have always used Linux on the side for fun and tinkering but never tried it full time until a couple of years ago. I have been trying various distros for a while now, switching between Ubuntu Unity, Linux Cinamon, Manjaro, until I tried Kubuntu with KDE plasma. The sheer amount of cuztomizations right out of the box and support for HiDPI screen for Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro meant I could stick to this for a while.</description>

      <description>In an effort to keep things local, some good folks at https://madeinca.ca/ have compiled a list Canadian companies &amp;lsquo;so you can support Canadian jobs and Canadian workers. I felt like supporting them.</description>
