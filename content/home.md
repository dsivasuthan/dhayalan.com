Hi.
I am Siva. 

I am a CompSci graduate from Ryerson University, currently working as a Full Stack Web Developer in Toronto. I'm also a novice photographer, environmentalist/minimalist, among other things.

I also freelance depending on type of project. Send me an [email](mailto:me@sivasuthan.com) to get a quote.
