title: Customizing VS Code

The following is a list of software I have found before but I could never rememeber the name when I am trying to brag about them to someone. So, I am putting it back where I found them. I am not planning on categorizing the list. I am just going to append to the list as I come across interesting projects on Hacker News and other sources. Consider this my TODO list, so this is neither exhaustive nor meant to be a guide.
