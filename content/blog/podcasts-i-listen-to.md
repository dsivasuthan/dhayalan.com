As I much as I do like to boast about the sheer amount podcasts listen(ed) to, it is not the intention of this posts. Rather, I find this a good place to share such details about me and document myself. Think of these pages like my facebook wall, minus the likes and comments, plus the added bonus of privacy. This page is something I control and no third party has access to it (except Google analytics, until I configure matamo). 

## Podcasts I highly recommend:
* Serial 
* Freakonomics Radio
* This American Life (select episodes)
* 99% Invisible
* Stuff You Should Know
* Invisibilia (only 1st season)
* Reply All (early episodes)
* TED Radio Hour (select episodes)
* Philosphize This!
* TechKatha

There are some good CBC ones I listened to. You could choose one depending on your taste.
