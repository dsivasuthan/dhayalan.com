As I much as I do like to boast about the sheer amount podcasts listen(ed) to, it is not the intention of this posts. Rather, I find this a good place to share such details about me and document myself. I don't facebook telling 3rd party service that I am into money just because I listen to Freakonomic and Planet Money. This page is something I control and no third party has access to it (except Google analytics, until I configure matamo). 

## Podcasts I highly recommend:
* Serial 
* Freakonomics Radio
* This American Life (only select episodes)
* 99% Invisible
* Stuff You Should Know
* Invisibilia (only 1st season, then I stopped)

There are some good CBC ones I listened to. You could choose one depending on your taste.
