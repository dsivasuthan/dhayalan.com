title: Get Motivated
draft: true
---

When you spend half your wake time on the interwebs every single day, you are bound to come across some materials that you find amusing, clever or motivating. That does not mean, I need constant motivation through somebody else's work but some work or compilation do open a different kind world you have never explored or thought of. The following are some of meterials I had clipped some years back on Evernote (sorry, Evernote, you dug your own grave). I had to put it somewhere before I wiped em clean.


* “Security is a process, not a product.” — Bruce Schneier
* Feel the fear and do it anyway. 
* "Never bring management a problem, bring them a solution." -LH
* One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done.- Marie Curie
* The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.
 
10. "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."

2. "A smooth sea never made a skillful sailor." 
1. "Those who do not give a fuck change the world. The rest do not."
