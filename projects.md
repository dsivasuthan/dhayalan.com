# projects
These projects are done in my free time and most of them are as old as 15 years. Work projects are not listed here, but they showcase my skills better than any of these projects do. Contact me if you want to know about my work projects. Thank you.

## Some work projects:
  * Ryerson United Way
    Built on CQ5.
  * Ozawa – Built on WordPress.
  * A lot of company admin panels – please ask me.

## Non-work projects:

### Android Applications:

#### Simple Sketch
    I got tired of feature-rich and slow note-taking apps that require whole bunch of permissions to run. So, I made my own simple app to draw and save hand-drawn notes. The only permission it requires is the access to Storage to save the created note. Not even a permission to connect to Internet is required, and it loads super fast.


### Chrome Extensions:

#### Chrome Sound Effects
  Add sounds to events triggered by user in Chrome, like switching tabs, etc. They can be manually disabled.
#### Change all UI fonts
  Changes all the font-faces on all the web sites to a user given local font. Enter your desired font in the options by clicking the extension icon.


Simple Windows/Web Applications:

Mockups:

School Projects:

lifelens – A simple photo curation web service. What is special about this service is that it’s designed to present user photos in a Timeline view. The algorithm extracts EXIF data from the uploaded photos and creates the Timeline by itself without user interaction. Just view one example.
chatter – A Twitter-like public chat engine, very simple implementation using Perl and php. mirror

Preserving Golden Treasures:

Thirukural (திருக்குறள்) – Thiruvalluvar wrote this classic Tamil sangam literature, consisting of 1330 couplets or Kurals, sometime between the third and first centuries BCE. I came across this compilation some time ago and made a copy/backup for myself. Thanks to all those who help compile this timeless piece of writing.

Old Stuff:
my old homepage – created when I could not afford a web host.
some old visual basic applications – I remember coding from morning to night, when I did not have an internet connection (in Sri Lanka), looking at textbooks, trying all the snippets of code. I had to wait till next week to go to Internet Cafe and lookup something I needed to know, which I had typed out in a txt file, which had other links from pages I had saved as html files.
